# Rock, Paper, Scissors - Kaggle

Welcome to the [Rock, Paper, Scissors simulation competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rock-paper-scissors/)! (Or is it Paper, Scissors, Rock?)

How can such a simple game with three possible outcomes be anything other than random chance? Well, it's time to determine if artificial intelligence can learn game theoryâ€¦

**Playground Simulation Competition** - In this repository, we present the set of strategies to "solve" this problem.  

**Disclaimer** - It is just a serie of attempts and theories.
